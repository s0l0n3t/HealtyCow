## Thanks
*I am proud to share that my project "HealthyCow," which aims to detect diseases early and analyze health data in cattle farming, has been deemed suitable for support under the TUBITAK 2209-A/2 University Students Research Projects Support Program, in which I have taken on the role of a software developer.
I owe immense gratitude to our esteemed advisor, Associate Professor Dr. Ali NARÄ°N, for his consultancy services in our project.
I would also like to extend my thanks to the valuable TUBITAK family and Professor Dr. Hasan Mandal for their role in making such a program possible and ensuring its sustainability.*
